# My Profile App

#### Using jQuery, developed an interactive Portfolio application that can read all data from a JSON file.
#### Single page app using HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, Bootstrap in an Object Oriented Javascript Pattern.

## Features

        Built in Javascript using the Object Oriented Pattern.
        Dynamically modifies the DOM to display the information.
        Further customized the project by personalizing the design using CSS and Bootstrap.
        Resume builder, change the data to suit your needs and it feeds into the app.
        Optimized with a gulp work flow for images, js, css minification, compression, concatenation, uglify.
        Google Maps API creates marker locations from the json file.
        Street view of my home town.

## Optimization

    Use gulp to minify critical css and js in-lined in the index.html.
    Copy the minified style and script into the index(only if you edit the relevant src files).
    Gulp will now minify the html and the whole page will be minified.

    Gzip will only work on a gzip enabled server.
    With gzip you must edit the relevant paths to assets by adding the .gz extension.
    There is Pseudo code to help with this.

## Gulp

    Instructions are in the gulp file and in the console when you build.

## Mobile

    Device friendly is what this app is all about.
    Works and looks good on all devices and View-port Orientations.
