/*
IMPORTANT FOR GZIP
 If you use gzip you must add .gz to all picture path names.
 e.g. "dist/images/small/ninja.png" becomes "dist/images/small/ninja.png.gz".
 Gzip only works on gzip enabled servers.
 This site is hosted on github witch at the moment doe's not support gzip.

    "about": "Starting in 1995 I have been building, creating, reconstructing and reverse engineering websites. Extensive knowledge of Image, Video and Game Editors are the result of 10 years of game level mapping. Problem solving and debugging are second nature to me. All my time on the PC, I now devote to a solid understanding of JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 for modern web development. Soft skills include dedicated servers, database's and CMS Deployment Apache and more. I am motivated and goal-oriented with highly developed communication skills from retail and as a Customer Service Representative. I can effectively work with the creative team and clients.
